            oldsu! is a project that started in October 2020 by Eeveelution, the former owner of the initial project. The goal of it
            is to provide a fully working experience of older versions of osu!. We currently have the 2008 client supported and are planning
            the 2009 client (tbd). The current ownership lies by marshallracer, and is maintained by a volunteering team to provide
            you the experience many missed out on. oldsu! intends to fix the flaws of old versions, but we will never change gameplay in any
            way.
